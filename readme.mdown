# Sassy Modular Scale

## Put down the calculator and let Sass do the work.

Sassy Modular Scale is a Sass based mixin that calculates the incremental values of the modular scale in proportion to a set size and ratio. It was inspired by and adapted from Tim Brown's modularscale.com.

Sassy Modular Scale can be used as a [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) [extension](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/extensions/) and can be installed as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular-scale).

## Installation

Usage requires Sass. Visit [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com) to learn more and install.

`gem install modular-scale`

Add `require 'modular-scale'` to your Compass config file.

Import the file into your stylesheets: `@import 'modular-scale';`

## Alternative installation (without Compass)

Compass provides a way for Sass mixins to be easily required into a project, but we also support the following:

* Copy either `stylesheets/_modular-scale.sass` or `stylesheets/_modular-scale.scss` into your project's Sass directory
* Import the file into your Sass stylesheet to access the mixins and functions. For example, `@import vendor/modular-scale`

## Usage

Modular-scale should primarily be used as a function. Simply pass it through in place of any value to generate a value based on a modular scale.

```scss
width: modular-scale(2); // two up the modular scale
width: ms(2); // Shorthand for the line above
width: modular-scale(2, 1em); // two up the modular scale with a base size of 1em
width: modular-scale(2, 1em, $octave); // Same as above but on an octave scale
```

You can output a list to your terminal to help you find out what values are on your scale.

```scss
@include modular-scale-list($start, $end, $base-size, $ratio);
```

By default, it writes 0-20 on the scale. You can also use shorthand to make things more efficient.

```scss
@include ms-list; // shorthand without attributes
@include ms-list($start, $end, $base-size, $ratio); // shorthand with attributes
```

As a side effect of the modular-scale functions a `exponent` function is also available.

```scss
@include exponent($base, $exponent);
```

Sassy Modular Scale can be used as a function, mixin or a mixin that generates a range of classes to `@extend`.

```scss
// Use as a function. Fill in the multiple, base-size, and ratio
height: modular-scale(7, 16px, $golden);
```

This method will generate a range of classes to `@extend`

```scss
@include modular-scale-classes(6);

h1 { @extend .ms-2; }
h2 { @extend .ms-1; }
h3 { @extend .ms-0; }
```

You can also 'lace' multiple ratios together by passing them in as a list (space-separated)

```scss
.lace {
  width: ms(7, 16px, $golden $fourth);
}
```

You can also set the $base-size variable to a list to interrelate two significant known sizes in your design
*note:* the starting point of the scale will always be the *lowest* value in this list

```scss
.multibases {
  width: ms(7, 16px 300px, $golden);
}
```
  
You can use multiple $base-sizes and multiple $ratios together

```scss
.multibase-multiratio {
  width: ms(7, 16px 300px, $golden $fourth);
}
```


## Ratios

Below is a list of Ratios to choose from. By default, the variable `$ratio` is set to `$golden`.

* $golden: 1.618 
* $double-octave: (4 / 1)
* $major-twelfth: (3 / 1)
* $major-eleventh: (8 / 3)
* $major-tenth: (5 / 2)
* $octave: (2 / 1)
* $major-seventh: (15 / 8)
* $minor-seventh: (16 / 9)
* $major-sixth: (5 / 3)
* $minor-sixth: (8 / 5)
* $fifth: (3 / 2)
* $augfourth: (1 / âˆš2)
* $fourth: (4 / 3)
* $major-third: (5 / 4)
* $minor-third: (6 / 5)
* $major-second: (9 / 8)
* $minor-second: (16 / 15)
