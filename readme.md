# Sassy Modular Scale
## Put down the calculator and let Sass do the work.

# How to use

* First, you need to have Sass installed. Visit [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com)
* Copy or link the mixin to your project.
* Pull in the mixin as needed, in Sass: +modular-scale(attribute, base-value, scale, location-on-scale) or in SCSS: @include modular-scale(attribute, base-value, scale, location-on-scale);
